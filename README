A simple Java library that provides API to access contents of Hacker News
(http://news.ycombinator.com/)

This library doesnt interface with HN directly, but instead uses the JSON APIs 
exposed by http://api.ihackernews.com/ site. 
Thanks to Ronnie Roller (http://ronnieroller.com/) for exposing these JSON APIs.
